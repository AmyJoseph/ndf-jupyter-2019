    "from [*Python for Informatics: Exploring Information* by Charles Severance](http://www.pythonlearn.com/html-270/index.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\\[The\\] fact that computers are good at things that humans are not is why you need to become skilled at talking “computer language”. Once you learn this new language, you can delegate mundane tasks to your partner (the computer), leaving more time for you to do the things that you are uniquely suited for. You bring creativity, intuition, and inventiveness to this partnership.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> *In a sense, you need two skills to be a programmer:* <br>\n",
    "* *First, you need to know the programming language (Python) - you need to know the vocabulary and the grammar. You need to be able to spell the words in this new language properly and know how to construct well-formed “sentences” in this new language.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs called **interpreters** also understand the vocabulary and grammar of a particular language and translate it into instructions for the computer to carry out.\n",
    "\n",
    ">* *Second, you need to “tell a story”. In writing a story, you combine words and sentences to convey an idea to the reader. There is a skill and art in constructing the story, and skill in story writing is improved by doing some writing and getting some feedback. In programming, our program is the “story” and the problem you are trying to solve is the “idea”.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of learning how to code (or how to collaborate with programmers) is learning how to think programmatically, breaking down a task that needs to be done (the \"idea\") into a series of logical steps.\n",

    "Once you have Python installed on your computer, there are a few different ways you can run Python code.

Jupyter is a browser-based development environment, which allow users to create \"computational notebooks\".\n",

The format can drive exploration, iteration and play, and notebooks are increasingly used as teaching and learning tools.\n",
